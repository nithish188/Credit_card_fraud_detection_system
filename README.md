# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project implements a machine learning system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the popular `creditcard.csv` dataset. The system is trained on real transaction data and uses advanced techniques like data scaling, oversampling (SMOTE), and a Random Forest classifier to identify fraud with high accuracy.
